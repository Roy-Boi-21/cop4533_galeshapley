## Compile Instructions
1. Clone into a CLion repository.
2. Run the program in CLion.

## Matcher & Verifier Instructions
The matcher and verifier run together in the same program.
They will execute after all the data has been parsed in the
program.  There are three ways to input data.
1. Manually typing out the data by hand.
2. Passing in a text file.
3. Randomly generating the data.

After all the data has been processed, the output of the 
matching will go a file called "output.txt" and the console
will output whether the match is valid and stable, 
invalid, or unstable.

## Assumptions
Every file must be in the "cmake-build-debug" folder for the program to read the file.
This program assumes you're running it in the CLion IDE with
the C++ standard set to C++ 17.
